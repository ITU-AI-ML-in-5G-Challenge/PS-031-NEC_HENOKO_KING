# PS-031-NEC_HENOKO_KING
This codes were made in Ubuntu 18.04, Jetson Xavier.
You have to create "original.mp4" file and "received_[number]kbps_[packet-loss ratio].mp4" so that estimate netowork status.
Also you have to change path in every code like this:
path = "{Your directory path}/Dataset_of_noise/"
Sorry for the inconvenience.
